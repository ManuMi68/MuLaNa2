Muzzio Lab Neuroscience Analysis -2

This is a set of statistical analysis codes written in R.
It is oriented for the robust analysis of experimental designs,
including on-way, two-way & three-way, between and Mixed.

The data is included in the folder "NeuroSpatialData".

The code is organized in an html file that includes all the explanations and details:
"NeuralSpatial.html".
Alternatively the code is also included in the RStudio file:
"NeuralSpatial.Rmd".

The complete code is included for the analysis of all the data of the paper
"Distinct neural mechanisms for heading retrieval and context recognition in the hippocampus during spatial reorientation".
The code can be copied from the different chunks, organized from the Figures on the paper.
As the code executes, the results (files with anovas and graphics) are stored in the folder "Design_Sleep3",
while they are displayed in the output window.

Once in the R program, install the libraries:
install.packages(c("rtf"), repos = "http://cran.r-project.org").
install.packages(c("parallel","data.table","ggplot2","dplyr", "ARTool", "lubridate", "kableExtra","caret","hrbrthemes", "modeest")).
devtools::install_github("kassambara/ggpubr").
For Robust Analysis:
Source Rand Wilcox Robust Analysis Code from https://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/rwilcox/software/.
This program uses the version: source("Rallfun-v40vMM.txt"), 
that corresponds to the version Rallfun-v40.txt with a few improvements
Adapted functions include the suffix "_vMM"
